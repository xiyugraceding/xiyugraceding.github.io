I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Informatics and Data Science at Johns Hopkins University, with extensive experience developing and applying Bayesian hierarchical modeling, Natural Language Processing, and multi-modal modeling techniques to problems in the biomedical sciences.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning, natural language processing, and healthcare informatics. I am particularly interested in:

- **Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling**: Developing ontology-informed transfer learning models for federated analytics
- **Natural Language Processing in Healthcare**: Clinical text analysis, sentiment extraction, and automated triage systems
- **Multi-modal Deep Learning**: Integrating medical imaging, biomarkers, and clinical data for disease prediction
- **Health Informatics**: Social determinants of health, clinical phenotyping, and observational health data analysis
