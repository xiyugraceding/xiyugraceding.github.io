I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Informatics and Data Science at Johns Hopkins University, with over seven years of experience developing AI and machine learning methods for healthcare. My work sits at the intersection of causal inference, natural language processing, and multimodal modeling, with a focus on health equity and real-world clinical impact.

I am also a co-founder of 未医智源, a Shanghai-based startup partnering with Hunan Cancer Hospital and Fudan University to develop LLM- and agent-based systems for automated ICD-10 coding, clinical documentation improvement and analyses of survey data.

## Research Themes
### Bayesian & Multimodal Modeling
Transfer learning frameworks and multimodal integration (imaging, biomarkers, clinical data) to improve prediction in small or underrepresented populations.
### Real-World Evidence & Causal Inference
Federated analyses across 10+ international healthcare databases (>5M patients) and self-controlled case series models for social determinants of health.
### Natural Language Processing in Healthcare
Multitask learning for specialty referral triage, phenotype extraction, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for study identification.

<!-- ### Real-World Evidence & Causal Inference
•	Led federated analyses across 10+ international healthcare databases (OHDSI/LEGEND-T2DM; >5 million patients) to evaluate sex differences in the comparative effectiveness and safety of second-line type 2 diabetes therapies.
•	Developed self-controlled case series models to assess the impact of social determinants of health, addressing social bias in clinical systems.

### Natural Language Processing in Healthcare
•	Built multitask models for specialty referral classification and automated triage in eConsult systems.
•	Developed sentiment extraction models and ACHD phenotype classifiers from clinical narratives.
•	Applied parameter-efficient prototypical fine-tuning for immunotherapy study identification.

I also realized that 
the majority of my work has emphasize on the health equity, where we studies the disparities in the health system, 

1. eConsult system was built for the under-represented population
2. racial and social economic disparities of post-partum depression
3. developing the bayesian transfer learning model to help improve prediciton and causal effect estimations in the small or under-represented population
4. assessing the impact of social determinants of health -->

<!-- More about me:
I was fortunate to spend my last year in college working full-time at Duke Kunshan University as a research analyst.
My internship at Eli Lilly focus on the intermittent demand prediction (IDP), I quickly learned about the state-of-the-art models for time series modeling -->
