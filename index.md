I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Informatics and Data Science at Johns Hopkins University, with over seven years of experience developing AI and machine learning methods for healthcare. My work spans bayesian modeling, federated analytics, natural language processing, and multimodal modeling, with a focus on health equity and real-world clinical impact.

I am also a co-founder of 未医智源, a Shanghai-based startup partnering with Hunan Cancer Hospital and Fudan University to develop LLM- and agent-based systems for automated ICD-10 coding, clinical documentation, and analyses of survey data.


## Research Themes

### Bayesian Hierarchical Transfer Learning
- Hierarchical transfer learning frameworks that borrow strength from large datasets to improve inference in small or underrepresented populations.
- Developed global–local shrinkage priors for high-dimensional sparse settings and efficient rejection-sampling algorithms to enable scalable posterior inference in federated and clinical/genetic applications.

### Real-World Evidence & Causal Inference
- Conducting large-scale federated causal analyses across 10+ international healthcare databases (>5M patients) to evaluate sex difference in the effectiveness and safety of second-line T2D agents.
- Quantify the impact of social determinants of health on diabetes management.

### Natural Language Processing in Healthcare
- Specialty referral triage, phenotype extraction, sentiment classification, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning in resource-constrained healthcare settings.

### Multimodal Models
- Developing cross-attention architectures to integrate imaging, biomarkers, and clinical text for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis.
- Emphasize low-compute, high-efficiency modeling strategies that maintain performance under limited data and infrastructure constraints.

<!-- ### Real-World Evidence & Causal Inference
•	Led federated analyses across 10+ international healthcare databases (OHDSI/LEGEND-T2DM; >5 million patients) to evaluate sex differences in the comparative effectiveness and safety of second-line type 2 diabetes therapies.
•	Developed self-controlled case series models to assess the impact of social determinants of health, addressing social bias in clinical systems.

### Natural Language Processing in Healthcare
•	Built multitask models for specialty referral classification and automated triage in eConsult systems.
•	Developed sentiment extraction models and ACHD phenotype classifiers from clinical narratives.
•	Applied parameter-efficient prototypical fine-tuning for immunotherapy study identification.

### Bayesian & Multimodal Modeling
Transfer learning frameworks and multimodal integration (imaging, biomarkers, clinical data) to improve prediction in small or underrepresented populations. -->

I also realized that 
the majority of my work has emphasize on the health equity, where we studies the disparities in the health system, 

1. eConsult system was built for the under-represented population
2. racial and social economic disparities of post-partum depression
3. developing the bayesian transfer learning model to help improve prediciton and causal effect estimations in the small or under-represented population
4. assessing the impact of social determinants of health -->

<!-- More about me:
I was fortunate to spend my last year in college working full-time at Duke Kunshan University as a research analyst.
My internship at Eli Lilly focus on the intermittent demand prediction (IDP), I quickly learned about the state-of-the-art models for time series modeling -->
