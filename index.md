I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Informatics and Data Science at Johns Hopkins University, with 7 years of experience working in AI in for healthcare, developing and applying AI/ML techniques to problems in the clinical and biomedical sciences.
Training in biomedical informatics, NLP, biostatistics, compuational biology

Currently I'm also a co-founder of 未医智源 (a shanghai-based startup), partnering with Hunan Cancer Hospital, exploring LLM/agentic AI for auto ICD-10 code annotation. We are also partnering with Fudan University to improve the documentation and analyses of survey based data.


My research has spanned the following fields,


Real-world evidence/Causal inference 

-- using a self-control case series to study the impact of social deterimnants of health, by taking individuals as their own control.  the model is utliztize to tackle to problem that the absence of social issues document in the system is not equal to patients not experiencing the issues. 
-- led the federated analytics across 10+ international healthcare databases (OHDSI/LEGEND-T2DM; >5M patients) to evaluate sex differences in the comparative effectiveness and safety of second-line T2DM therapies

NLP in healthcare

-- understanding the specialty referral needs in eConsult system, multitask learning to classifying econsult data, automated triage
-- sentiment extact
-- ACHD phenotype classification
-- parameter-efficient prototypical fine-tuning for immonotherapy study identification

Multi-modal Deep Learning**: Integrating medical imaging, biomarkers, and clinical data for disease prediction

I also realized that 
the majority of my work has emphasize on the health equity, where we studies the disparities in the health system, 

1. eConsult system was built for the under-represented population
2. racial and social economic disparities of post-partum depression
3. developing the bayesian transfer learning model to help improve prediciton and causal effect estimations in the small or under-represented population
4. assessing the impact of social determinants of health

Education:
1. PhD, Biomedical Informatics and Data Science, The Johns Hopkins University (2021 -)
2. MS, Computational Biology, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (20)
3. BS, Biological Science, Nanjing University

Experiences:
1. Eli Liily, Advanced Intelligence - research intern
2. CHIP, Boston Children's Hospital
3. Dana-Farber
3. 


More about me:
I was fortunate to spend my last year in college working full-time at Duke Kunshan University as a research analyst.
My internship at Eli Lilly focus on the intermittent demand prediction (IDP), I quickly learned about the state-of-the-art models for time series modeling, blablabla
