I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Informatics and Data Science at Johns Hopkins University, with extensive experience developing and applying Bayesian hierarchical modeling, Natural Language Processing, and multi-modal modeling techniques to problems in the biomedical sciences.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning, natural language processing, and healthcare informatics. I am particularly interested in:

- **Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling**: Developing ontology-informed transfer learning models for federated analytics
- **Natural Language Processing in Healthcare**: Clinical text analysis, sentiment extraction, and automated triage systems
- **Multi-modal Deep Learning**: Integrating medical imaging, biomarkers, and clinical data for disease prediction
- **Health Informatics**: Social determinants of health, clinical phenotyping, and observational health data analysis

## Current Research

I am currently working on several exciting projects:

### OHDSI/LegendT2DM Study
Comparing effectiveness of second-line treatments for type 2 diabetes in a large-scale network study, developing Bayesian hierarchical transfer learning models that have improved predictions on small datasets by up to 50%.

### Alzheimer's Disease Classification
Developing multi-modal deep learning models incorporating cross-attention mechanisms to predict AD status using 3D MRI images, Jacobian maps, and CSF biomarkers.

### Clinical NLP Applications
Working on transformer-based models for clinical phenotype classification, sentiment extraction in psychiatric discharge summaries, and automated triage systems for specialty referrals.

## Background

I completed my MS in Computational Biology at Harvard University (2020) and my BS in Biological Science at Nanjing University (2018). My interdisciplinary background spans computer science, statistics, and life sciences, enabling me to bridge the gap between computational methods and biomedical applications.

## Technical Skills

**Programming**: Python (PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy), R, SQL  
**Machine Learning**: Deep Learning, NLP, Bayesian Methods, Transfer Learning  
**Tools**: Git, HPC, Linux, Docker  
**Domains**: Clinical Informatics, Genomics, Medical Imaging, Federated Learning
